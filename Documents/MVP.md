# Bank Loan Term Prediction
## MVP
The goal of this project is to predict the type of loan the bank should give to a costumer whether a long-term loan or short-term loan by a classification model.



To start the classification, work a baseline model was needed to compare the affect of any modification in the data and the model.
After cleaning the data by dropping duplicated rows and the outliers, 
the baseline model has been chosen to be KNN model and it gave 0.815 training accuracy and 0.739 for the validation.
