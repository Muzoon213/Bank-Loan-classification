# Project Proposal
### Bank Loan classification regression
---

## Description:
Loan Status Classification Here in this notebook we take a look at the data from a bank/financial organization of all their loans. We explore various features about the borrowers like credit score, mortgage, annual income, years of employment and try to train our classifer to predict if the loan would be paid or not.


## Data:
The data for this project will be read into a CSV file, The dataset provided in Kaggle. ( you can find the dataset [HERE](https://www.kaggle.com/zaurbegiev/my-dataset) ).
The obtained dataset consists of over 110,000 loan records with 18 features. Some of them may effect on our target (type of loan term) such as: the loan amount, the purpose of the loan, and the customer's annual incomeâ€¦ etc.


## Goals:
The goal of this project is to build multiple machine learning classification models and calculate the accuracy of each model, then perform a comparison between all built models to decide which one is the best. Therefore, the project will predict the type of loan whether it is short term or long term based on many features. This project, will help bankers to determine the type of loan term that the customer needs.


## Tools:
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Sklearn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
