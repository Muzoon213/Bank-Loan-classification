# Project Proposal
### Bank Loan classification regression
---

## Description:
The loan is one of the most important schemes of banks and it can be short term or long term, depending on the purpose of the loan. For example, if the loan is for buying a house, then most probably it will be a long term loan. To be more specific, short term loans are called such because of how quickly the loan needs to be paid off. In most cases, it must be paid off within two years. Any longer loan than that is considered a long term loan.


## Data:
The data for this project will be read into a CSV file, The dataset provided in Kaggle. ( you can find the dataset [HERE](https://www.kaggle.com/zaurbegiev/my-dataset) ).
The obtained dataset consists of over 110,000 loan records with 18 features. Some of them may effect on our target (type of loan term) such as: the loan amount, the purpose of the loan, and the customer's annual incomeâ€¦ etc.


## Goals:
The goal of this project is to build multiple machine learning classification models and calculate the accuracy of each model, then perform a comparison between all built models to decide which one is the best. Therefore, the project will predict the type of loan whether it is short term or long term based on many features. This project, will help bankers to determine the type of loan term that the customer needs.


## Tools:
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Sklearn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
