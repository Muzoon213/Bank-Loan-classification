# Bank_Loan_classification
as part of T5 Bootcamp, Soad, Muzoon and I built Classification regression for Bank Loan Status


Loan Status Classification Here in this notebook we take a look at the data from a bank/financial organization of all their loans. We explore various features about the borrowers like credit score, mortgage, annual income, years of employment and try to train our classifer to predict if the loan would be paid or not.
